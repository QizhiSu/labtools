Description: This package aims to provide a set of tools to help facilitate the 
    handling of laboratory data. At the moment, there are only two functions. one
    is to to help read and align compound lists of different samples, and the other 
    one is to convert any list of chemicals into structure database used by MS-FINDER.
    It is still under active development. In the future, more functions will be 
    incorporated based on the need.
